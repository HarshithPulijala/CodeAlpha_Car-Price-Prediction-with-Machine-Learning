# 🚗 Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning

This project aims to predict the price of a car based on its various features using supervised machine learning techniques. It helps users understand how different factors influence a car's resale value and provides insights to support buying or selling decisions.

## 📌 Project Objectives
- Analyze and understand the relationship between car attributes and price.
- Apply machine learning algorithms to accurately predict car prices.
- Evaluate and compare model performance using appropriate metrics.
- Deliver insights that help users and dealerships make informed pricing decisions.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Techniques Used
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Correlation analysis, visualizations (heatmaps, boxplots, scatter plots).
- **Modeling**: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest Regressor.
- **Evaluation**: R² Score, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Residual Plots.

## 📊 Features Used
- Car brand and model  
- Year of manufacture  
- Transmission type  
- Fuel type  
- Kilometers driven  
- Owner history  
- Selling price (target variable)

## 🔍 Insights Derived
- Newer cars and those with fewer kilometers tend to have higher resale value.
- Fuel type and transmission also influence price, with automatic cars typically priced higher.
- Random Forest model showed the best accuracy, suggesting non-linear relationships among features.
